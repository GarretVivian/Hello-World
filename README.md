Welcome to my GitHub page. I am currently a junior at the University of Iowa studying business analytics and information systems and am learning how to use this software correctly and will be making an example README.md file. 

##  My project 
Welcome to my projects! Here is a list of what I have been working on throughout my 3 years at the University of Iowa. 

## Description
The projects I have created revolve around business analytics and information systems. 

## Project title 
**A day in the eyes of a BAIS student**

## How do I properly run this program?
Great question. To probably run this program you will need a short set of files downloaded on your device. 
1. File #1
2. File #2
3. File #3

All of this data came from the internet and will have hyper links attatched to their names to easily access them. 

## Additional Documentation
At this current point in time there is no additional doumentation needed to run this program. *However*, in the near future there may be updates so continue to refresh this page daily for future updates!

Thank you for reading this page on my file and I hope to see you around my page more often!
